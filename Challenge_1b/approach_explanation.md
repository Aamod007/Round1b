# Approach Explanation

## Overview

The Document Intelligence System is engineered for precise, multilingual information extraction from PDF documents. It combines advanced semantic search models with intelligent layout analysis to deliver contextually relevant content tailored to specific personas and tasks.

### 1. **Semantic Query Construction**

- The process starts by synthesizing a semantic query using the `persona` and `job_to_be_done` fields from the input JSON.
- This query encapsulates the user's intent and sets the standard for what content is considered relevant.

### 2. **Layout-Aware Sectioning**

- PDFs are parsed with **PyMuPDF**, which provides low-level access to document layout.
- The system analyzes font size, weight, and spacing to heuristically define logical sections (headings, subheadings, body text).
- This ensures that content is segmented in a manner that reflects the document's structure.

### 3. **Multilingual Semantic Ranking (Stage 1)**

- Each extracted section is transformed into a dense vector using the `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` model.
- The model supports multiple languages, allowing for seamless processing of international documents.
- The system computes the similarity between each section vector and the semantic query to rank sections by relevance.

### 4. **Paragraph-Level Refinement (Stage 2)**

- The highest-ranked sections undergo a second analysis at the paragraph level.
- Paragraphs are independently embedded and scored for relevance to the query.
- This two-stage approach (section, then paragraph) improves precision and ensures that only the most pertinent text is extracted.

### 5. **Multilingual Handling**

- The use of a multilingual transformer model ensures accurate semantic matching regardless of the document's language.
- This enables consistent performance across diverse datasets.

### 6. **Output Generation**

- The pipeline compiles the top 5 most relevant sections and their refined paragraphs into a structured JSON output (`generated_output.json`).
- A consolidated summary of the methodology (`approach_explanation.md`) is also generated for transparency and reproducibility.

## Key Advantages

- **Language Agnostic:** Works seamlessly across major languages.
- **Contextual Accuracy:** Two-stage semantic filtering provides precise, task-aligned results.
- **Adaptable:** Easily customizable for new personas or task requirements.
