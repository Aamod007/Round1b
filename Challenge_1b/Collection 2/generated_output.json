Type your user name and password, or follow the directions to create an account. Select Next, and then select Finish. Once the roaming ID is added, it can be used for signing or encryption. When you perform a task that uses your roaming ID, you’re automatically logged in to the roaming ID server if your authentication assertion hasn’t expired. PKCS#12 modules and tokens You can have multiple digital IDs that you use for different purposes, particularly if you sign documents in different roles or using different certification methods. Digital IDs are usually password protected. They can be stored on your computer in PKCS #12 file format. Digital IDs can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows certificate store. Roaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can access digital IDs from various locations. Register the digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available for use. Store certificates on directory servers Directory servers are commonly used as centralized repositories of identities within an organization. The server acts as an ideal location to store user certificates in enterprises that use certificate encryption. Directory servers let you locate certificates from network servers, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. After you locate a certificate, you can add it to your list of trusted identities so that you don’t have to look it up again. By developing a storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your workgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the workgroup. For more information about directory servers, see the Digital Signature Guide. Import directory server settings (Windows only) You import directory server settings using security import/export methodology or a security settings file. Before, you import settings in a file using import/export methodology, ensure that you trust the file provider before opening it.",

You can change the default signing method or format, in the Signatures panel of the Preferences dialog box. Under Creation & Appearance, click More. Setting up certificate-based signatures You can expedite the signing process and optimize your results by making the following preparations in advance. Note: Some situations require using particular digital IDs for signing. For example, a corporation or government agency can require individuals to use only digital IDs issued by that agency to sign official documents. Inquire about the digital signature policies of your organization to determine the appropriate source of your digital ID. • Get a digital ID from your own organization, buy a digital ID (see the Adobe website for security partners), or create a self-signed one. See Create a self-signed digital ID. You can’t apply a certificate-based signature without a digital id. • Set the default signing method. • Create an appearance for your certificate-based signature. (See Create the signature appearance.) • Use the Preview Document mode to suppress any dynamic content that can alter the appearance of the document and mislead you into signing an unsuitable document. For information about using the Preview Document mode, see Sign in Preview Document mode. • Review all the pages in a document before you sign. Documents can contain signature fields on multiple pages. • Configure the signing application. Both authors and signers should configure their application environment.

Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp authority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and reduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party timestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID. Timestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box. If a timestamp server is configured, the timestamp appears in the Date/Time tab of the Signature Properties dialog box. If no timestamp server is configured, the signatures field displays the local time of the computer at the moment of signing. Note: If you did not embed a timestamp when you signed the document, you can add one later to your signature. (See Establish long-term signature validation.) A timestamp applied after signing a document uses the time provided by the timestamp server. Configure a timestamp server To configure a timestamp server, you need the server name and the URL, which you can obtain from an administrator or a security settings file. If you have a security settings file, install it and don’t use the following instructions for configuring a server. Ensure that you obtained the security settings file from a trusted source. Don’t install it without checking with your system administration or IT department. 1. Open the Preferences dialog box. 2. Under Categories, select Signatures. 3. For Document Timestamping, click More. 4. Select Time Stamp Servers on the left. 5. Do one of the following: • If you have an import/export methodology file with the timestamp server settings, click the Import button . Select the file, and select Open.",

With AI Assistant in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader, Adobe takes an LLM-agnostic approach, selecting best-in-class technologies that address a range of customer use cases. We currently have integrated the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service with our proprietary technologies to provide generative AI capability in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader. Does adobe concurrently train any large language models (“LLMS”) with your content while you're using generative ai features in acrobat? No. Acrobat does not train any LLMs on your content concurrent to your interactions with generative AI in Acrobat. Prompts provided to AI Assistant do not modify the underlying model. Your content will not be used to train any LLMs that deliver Acrobat’s generative AI capability.
